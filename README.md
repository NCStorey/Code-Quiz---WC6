# Code-Quiz---WC6

## Description

Made in response to the week 6 challenge at Trilogy Education skills bootcamp.

We were tasked with using Java Script to create a JS quiz. The acceptance criteria included:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Installation

No special installation is necessary. file type include HTML, CSS and JavaSript and should run on most browsers.

## Usage

The project is to be used as a learning aid by students who are studying Java-script. I made copius notes in the script files so once they have done the quiz they can look at the files and follow my logic.

It can also be used by potential furture employers to see my learning journey.
